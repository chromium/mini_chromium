mini_chromium

This is mini_chromium, a small collection of useful low-level (“base”)
routines from the Chromium open-source project at
http://www.chromium.org/ . Chromium is large, sprawling, full of
dependencies, and a web browser. mini_chromium is small, self-contained,
and a library. mini_chromium is especially useful as a dependency of
other code that wishes to use Chromium’s base routines. By using
mini_chromium, other projects’ code can function in a standalone
environment outside of Chromium without having to treat all of Chromium
as a dependency. When building as part of Chromium, those projects’ code
can use Chromium’s own (non-mini_chromium) base implementation.

Code provided in mini_chromium provides the same interface as the
equivalent code in Chromium. One major difference is that
"base/basictypes.h" does not provide its own precise-width integral
types such as int8 and uint64. To use mini_chromium, use <stdint.h>
types such as int8_t and uint64_t. See http://crbug.com/138542 and
https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/d/topic/chromium-dev/zFzvBFptJj4/ .

While it’s a goal of mini_chromium to maintain interface compatibility
with Chromium’s base library for the interfaces it does implement,
there’s no requirement that it use the same implementations as
Chromium’s base library. Many of the implementations used in
mini_chromium are identical to Chromium’s, but many others have been
modified to eliminate dependencies that are not desired in
mini_chromium, and a few are completely distinct from Chromium’s
altogether. Additionally, when mini_chromium provides an interface in
the form of a file or class present in Chromium, it’s not bound to
provide all functions, methods, or types that the Chromium equivalent
does. The differences noted above notwithstanding, the interfaces
exposed by mini_chromium’s base are and must remain a strict subset of
Chromium’s.
